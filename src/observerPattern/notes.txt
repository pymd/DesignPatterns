Observer Pattern:
    - Used to model a one-to-many relationships between objects
    - Many Observers can 'subscribe' to the same Subject
    - Works like a news subscription model

    - Each Observer can subscribe or unsubscribe itself to the Subject
    - Subject maintains a list of Observers subscribed to itself.
